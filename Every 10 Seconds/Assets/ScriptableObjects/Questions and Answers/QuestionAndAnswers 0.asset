  question: Good day! From your attire, you must be the youngest son of the Dolphinly
    family. I'm Lady Dolphinington. What are your favorite dolphin activities? Mine
    are echolocation and disliking sharks.
  correctAnswer: I love doing cool flips and hanging out with my pod!
  incorrectAnswer: I have eaten over one hundred baby seals.
  correctResponse: Oh ho hoo! I too love doing cool flips and hanging out with my
    pod. You truly are a dolphin among dolphins! I hope to see you at the Dauphin's
    Ball...
  wrongResponse: Wait a minute... do I spot several rows of triangular teeth specially
    shaped to kill? You're no dolphin! Guards! Arrest this impostor!
