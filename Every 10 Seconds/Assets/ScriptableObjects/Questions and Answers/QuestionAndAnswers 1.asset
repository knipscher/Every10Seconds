  question: Did you hear the gossip about Dolphne Bridgerfin? Apparently she was
    seen sleeping with both her eyes closed! What do you think of that?
  correctAnswer: What a strange way to sleep! I always sleep with one eye open.
  incorrectAnswer: How silly! I never sleep, because I will die if I stop moving.
  correctResponse: So true! I do the same, as do all of us dolphins. Perhaps she
    was extra sleepy from attending fancy formal dolphin events.
  wrongResponse: Huh? That's not a dolphin thing. In fact, that's... a shark thing!!
    Guards, please ram this imposter to death as a group with your strong snouts!
  timeoutResponse: Why aren't you responding? And why are you looking at me like
    I'm delicious? Wait, you're a shark! Guards! Kill this imposter!
