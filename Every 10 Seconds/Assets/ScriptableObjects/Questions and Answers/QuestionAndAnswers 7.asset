  question: My mother's in town for a visit! I love her, but she can be a tad difficult.
    What's your mother like?
  correctAnswer: 'She''s lovely. She helped me keep up with the group while I learned
    to swim! '
  incorrectAnswer: I don't know her well, although I met her briefly when she gave
    live birth to me and delivered me safely to the nursery.
  correctResponse: As my mother did too! Thank goodness we are mammals who live in
    social groups.
  wrongResponse: What? That doesn't sound like something a dolphin mother would do.
    That's a shark thing! Guards, please, kill this hideous beast immediately!
  timeoutResponse: Why aren't you responding? And why are you looking at me like
    I'm delicious? Wait, you're a shark! Guards! Kill this imposter!
