  question: I hate sharks, don't you? What's your least favorite thing that sharks
    do?
  correctAnswer: Eat seals and other mammals.
  incorrectAnswer: Whistle to friends!
  correctResponse: Agreed! It's disgusting that they do that. Sharks are disgusting
    and I hate them and they're bad.
  wrongResponse: What? Sharks don't whistle, we do. Why did you mix that up? Is that
    blood between your teeth? Oh no!!! Guards, get this shark!
  timeoutResponse: Why aren't you responding? And why are you looking at me like
    I'm delicious? Wait, you're a shark! Guards! Kill this imposter!
