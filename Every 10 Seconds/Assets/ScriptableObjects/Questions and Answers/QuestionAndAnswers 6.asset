  question: I hope this isn't too strange of a compliment, but your skin looks lovely
    today, dear Lord Dolphinly!
  correctAnswer: Thank you! It's soft and smooth because I am a dolphin.
  incorrectAnswer: Thank you! It's rough like sandpaper because I am a dolphin.
  correctResponse: Mine too! I love being soft and smooth. It makes it so much fun
    to slide through the water!
  wrongResponse: Wait a minute, that's what shark skin feels like! Have you been
    a shark this whole time? Betrayal! Ignominy! Guards, please, help!
  timeoutResponse: Why aren't you responding? And why are you looking at me like
    I'm delicious? Wait, you're a shark! Guards! Kill this imposter!
